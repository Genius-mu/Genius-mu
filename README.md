## Hi, I'm Mustapha 👋

A Nigerian Frontend developer and tech creator building and turning ideas into working production-grade applications across web, mobile not just polished UIs.

I’ve built projects ranging from a habit-tracking app that gamifies consistency with XP and charts, to a crypto trading interface designed for clarity, speed, and real user flow. I care about how things behave, not just how they look — structure, state, data flow, and user experience matter to me.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React (hooks, state, data handling)
- Next.js, TypeScript
- Axios, modern frontend workflows

### Featured Projects

**Vector - Physics Vector Solver**
-Vector is a React + Tailwind web app built to simplify vector operations in physics. It allows users to compute vector addition, subtraction, dot products, and cross products through a clean, intuitive interface. The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and usability—turning abstract vector math into an interactive learning and problem-solving experience.
