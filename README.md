## Hi, I'm Mustapha 👋

Frontend developer focused on turning ideas into working products, not just polished UIs.

I’ve built projects ranging from a habit-tracking app that gamifies consistency with XP and charts, to a crypto trading interface designed for clarity, speed, and real user flow. I care about how things behave, not just how they look — structure, state, data flow, and user experience matter to me.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React (hooks, state, data handling)
- Next.js, TypeScript
- Axios, modern frontend workflows

### 📌 Projects
- 🔹 Habit xp – A habit-tracking app that rewards daily, weekly, and monthly consistency with XP and visual progress charts
- 🔹 Crypto Rise – A modern crypto trading UI built with React and Tailwind CSS, focused on clean layouts and user flow
